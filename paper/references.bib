  abstract  = {The purpose of this paper is to show the application of global uncertainty analysis to comprehensive and reduced kinetic models as a tool to identify important thermochemical and reaction rate parameters as determinants of the conditions leading to autoignition. Propane oxidation is taken as the test case. The simulation of experimental investigations of the cool flames and two-stage ignitions{,} via the pressure-temperature ignition diagram{,} show that existing kinetic models for the low temperature combustion of propane at sub-atmospheric pressures reflect a greater reactivity than seems to be appropriate. That is{,} the models lead to a prediction of two-stage ignition at pressures somewhat lower and with ignition delays shorter than is found experimentally. The inconsistency between experiment and numerical simulation seems not to be an inherent problem of the qualitative structure of the models{,} but may derive from uncertainties in the parameters within the mechanism. By use of {"}brute force{"}{,} Morris-one-at-a-time and Monte-Carlo simulations{,} we show that uncertainties in only a small number of parameters{,} and falling well within the errors that may reasonably be assigned{,} can shift the response appropriately. Moreover{,} it appears that in the low temperature combustion regime{,} thermochemistry is at least as{,} if not more{,} important than the reaction rates{,} yet usually receives less attention within sensitivity studies. In the present case{,} the main factors controlling the temperature reached in the first stage of two-stage ignition and the time to ignition appear to be connected with the thermochemistry of three specific hydroperoxyalkyl radicals and their derivatives. Other factors{,} such as heat and mass transport are also addressed{,} and their effects are mitigated to some extent by evaluation of initial and revised models against experimental data for ignition delay obtained under microgravity. The results highlight more general issues that pertain to the numerical simulation of the combustion of higher hydrocarbons and contribute to the development of the protocol necessary for testing kinetic models before they are ready for use in a predictive capacity.},

  abstract  = {A method for assessing and comparing the impact of uncertainties in both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters on the predictions of combustion chemistry models has been developed. Kinetic{,} thermodynamic and overall uncertainty parameters are defined{,} which allow tracking the sources of uncertainties for a particular model result. The method was applied to premixed laminar methane-air flames using the Leeds Methane Oxidation Mechanism (K. J. Hughes et al.{,} Int. J. Chem. Kinet.{,} 2001{,} 33{,} 513). Heat of formation and rate coefficient data for species and elementary reactions{,} respectively{,} related to methane combustion were collected from several recent reviews and critically assessed error limits were assigned to them. Local rate coefficient sensitivities and heat of formation sensitivities were calculated for lean ([small phi] = 0.62){,} stoichiometric ([small phi] = 1.00) and rich ([small phi] = 1.20) laminar atmospheric premixed methane-air flames. Uncertainties of flame velocity{,} maximum flame temperature and also the value and location of maximum concentration of radicals H{,} O{,} OH{,} CH and CH2 were obtained from the sensitivities and the uncertainties of thermodynamic and chemical kinetic data. The uncertainty of the calculated flame velocity is typically 2-5 cm s-1. Maximum flame temperature and concentration of H{,} O{,} and OH can be calculated accurately{,} while there is high uncertainty in the calculated maximum concentration of CH and CH2. The calculations have revealed that the uncertainty of the calculated flame velocity is caused mainly by errors of the input rate coefficients. This is the case also for the calculated concentration of CH and CH2. The uncertainty of the location of concentration maxima is also of kinetics origin and it is caused by the very same rate coefficients that affect flame velocity. Uncertainty of maximum adiabatic flame temperature and maximum concentration of H{,} O and OH originates mainly from errors of the input heat of formation data. In order to obtain good simulation results for methane flames{,} accurate heats of formation are required in particular for radicals OH{,} CH2(S){,} CH2{,} CH2OH{,} HCCO and CH2HCO. Simulation results could be improved by better knowledge of the reaction rate parameters for the reactions O2 + H = OH + O{,} O2 + H + M = HO2 + M{,} CO + OH = CO2 + H{,} H + CH3(+M) = CH4(+M){,} CH3 + OH = CH2(S) + H2O{,} C2H2 + OH = C2H + H2O and C2H2 + CH = C2H + CH2. This conclusion is somewhat surprising since at least the first three reactions are among the most frequently studied ones in chemical kinetics. The calculations demonstrate that all simulation results of chemical kinetic modelling studies should be accompanied by uncertainty information (e.g. standard deviation) for the model outputs to indicate which results are well supported by the model and which ones are merely nominal values that were obtained using the selected set of input parameters.},

In chemical kinetics, models are usually based on differential equations and the results are concentration-time curves, reaction rates, and various kinetic features of the reaction. This review discusses in detail the concentration sensitivity, rate sensitivity, and feature sensitivity analysis of spatially homogeneous constant-parameter reaction systems. Sensitivity analyses of distributed parameter systems and of stochastic systems are also briefly described. Special attention is paid to the interpretation of sensitivity coefficients which can provide information about the importance and interconnection of parameters and variables. Applications of sensitivity analysis to uncertainty analysis, parameric scaling, parameter estimation, experimental design, stability analysis, repro-modeling, and investigation and reduction of complex reaction mechanisms are discussed profoundly.},

Fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich mixtures were oxidized at a constant fuel mole fraction (1000 ppm), at temperatures ranging from 450 to 1250 K, pressures of 1 and 10 atm, and constant residence time (70 and 700 ms, respectively). In total, six mixtures were tested at both pressures. Mole fraction profiles were obtained using gas chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectrometry. The fuel mole fraction profiles, as well as some reaction intermediate and product profiles indicated strong low-temperature chemistry at high pressure. On the other hand, at atmospheric pressure this behavior was observed to a very small extent and only with the lean and stoichiometric mixtures. These data were compared to modeling results using literature mechanisms for diethyl ether oxidation. None of these predicted low-temperature reactivity under present conditions. Therefore, a kinetic mechanism is proposed in this study, based on recently computed kinetic parameters from literature. It shows good performances for representing the present experimental data as well as experimental data found in literature consisting of ignition delay times, laminar flame speeds and flame structure.},

Result shows that the ignition delay times increase with the increase of the equivalence ratio and the decrease of the pressure. The only literature DEE mechanism (Yasunaga et al. model) was employed to simulate the experimental data and result shows that the model gives reasonable prediction on lean mixtures, while the prediction on stoichiometric mixtures is slightly higher. Sensitivity analysis was conducted to pick out the key reactions in the process of DEE ignition at high and low pressures, respectively. Reaction pathway analysis shows that the consumption of DEE is dominated by the H-abstraction reactions. Through linear analysis, a correlation for the DEE ignition data was obtained. Using this correlation, the measured DEE data were compared to the literature correlations of DME and n-butane, for they have the similar molecular structure. Result shows that DEE has the strongest overall reactivity among the three fuels, while that of DME and n-butane are comparable. Sensitivity analysis and radical pool analysis were conducted to gain a further understanding of the ignition process of the three fuels.},

  abstract = {Diethyl ether (DEE, C4H10O) is being considered as a promising biofuel. However, its combustion chemistry has not been well studied. Particularly lacking are quantitative intermediate species profiles in flames that provide a stringent test for kinetic models, and flame speed data at elevated pressures. In the present paper, we obtain species distributions in low-pressure flames and measure flame speeds at elevated pressure to gain insights into high-temperature combustion chemistry of DEE. Specifically, a fuel-rich DEE flame (ϕ∼1.8) with 25% argon dilution at 4kPa was investigated by using a dedicated combination of electron ionization (EI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) with gas chromatography (GC) and tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) photoionization (PI) MBMS. High-pressure flame speeds of DEE were measured in a constant-volume cylindrical chamber at an initial temperature of 298K at an equivalence ratio of ϕ=1.4 and pressure up to 507kPa. Moreover, a new detailed kinetic model for DEE combustion was developed, with the most noticeable advances over the solely existing model by Yasunaga et al., 2010 being a more complete description of the reactions of DEE radicals and the use of accurate theoretical methods, i.e. CBS-QB3, to determine the rate constants for important primary reactions. In contrast to the previously published one, the present model includes reactions of DEE radicals that directly involve the formation of ethyl vinyl ether (EVE), an addition supported by identification and quantification of EVE by PI-MBMS in the flame experiment. Finally, the results showed that DEE flames yield low concentrations of aromatic species. However, high acetaldehyde emission was observed, originating from the dominant pathways of DEE consumption via H-abstractions from C-α positions followed by β-scissions.},

  abstract  = {Producing and using renewable fuels for transportation is one approach for a sustainable energy future for the United States, as well as the rest of the world. Renewable fuels may also substantially reduce contributions to global climate change. In the transportation sector, ethanol produced from biomass shows promise as a future fuel for spark-ignited engines because of its high octane quality. Ethanol, however, is not a high-quality compression-ignition fuel. Ethanol can be easily converted through a dehydration process to produce diethyl ether (DEE), which is an excellent compression-ignition fuel with higher energy density than ethanol. DEE has long been known as a cold-start aid for engines, but little is known about using DEE as a significant component in a blend or as a complete replacement for diesel fuel. Dimethyl ether, the methanol analog to DEE, was recently reported to be a low-emission, high-quality diesel fuel replacement, but similar engine testing and process information on DEE is limited. To identify the potential of DEE as a transportation fuel, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of its utilization in engines and also conducted limited laboratory experiments. This paper presents the findings on fundamental engine and emissions performance of DEE, along with an estimated cost of producing DEE from biomass ethanol.},

  abstract = {Thermochemical properties play an important role for accurate predictions of ignition characteristics using chemical kinetic models due to their impact on energy balances and chemical equilibrium. Therefore, the acquisition and incorporation of accurate thermochemical data have been a major objective of many recent modeling studies. As an addition to these studies, the present work investigates the impact of species thermochemical data and of their uncertainties on the prediction of fuel combustion. Sensitivity analysis is used first to evaluate the effects of enthalpies of formation, standard entropies, and heat capacities of single species on ignition characteristics employing a recent diethyl ether model (Sakai et al., 2017). Modified strategies for uncertainty quantification, which have been traditionally used to quantify prediction uncertainties due to rate parameter uncertainties, are then applied to quantify the joint impact of uncertainties in the thermochemical data on the ignition delay times. Large prediction uncertainties are found in the negative temperature coefficient (NTC) regime, where different reaction channels compete with each other and thus, small shifts of chemical equilibria of reactions can strongly affect the reaction pathway. Moreover, automatic calibration of enthalpies of formation within their uncertainty limits is performed for a 2-methylhexane model (Mohamed et al., 2016) in order to demonstrate the potential for model improvement in terms of the thermochemical parameters. This optimization process significantly improves ignition delay time predictions at the conditions of interest. Overall, the results show that the predicted uncertainties, and thus the potential for optimization, are high at conditions where multiple reaction channels are competing each other, while they are relatively lower when the reaction pathway is unique.},

A stepwise mechanism involving the formation of a reactant complex in the entrance channel and a product complex in the exit channel has been recognized in part of the abstracting processes. A two-transition-state model is used in calculating the individual rate constant for the channels with a barrier-less process in the entrance channel. Variable reaction coordinate transition state theory (VRC-TST) has been used to calculate the rate constants of the barrier-less process.

The combination of ignition delay time and species composition data provide for a stringent test of the chemical kinetic mechanism. The reactions are classed into various types, and the reaction rate constants are given together with an explanation of how the rate constants were obtained. Experimental results from the literature of ignition behind reflected shock waves and in a rapid compression machine were used to develop and validate the reaction mechanism at both low and high temperatures. Additionally, species composition data from a variable pressure flow reactor and a jet-stirred reactor were used to help complement and refine the low-temperature portions of the reaction mechanism. A sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the combustion environments. This analysis showed that the low-temperature chemistry is very sensitive to the formation of stable olefin species from hydroperoxy-alkyl radicals and to the chain-branching steps involving ketohydroperoxide molecules.},

We start by considering a 30-dimensional stochastic germ in which each random variable is associated with one reaction class, and build a surrogate model for the ignition delay time using polynomial chaos expansions. The adaptive pseudo-spectral projection technique is used for this purpose. The surrogate model is used to estimate first-order and total-order sensitivity indices characterizing the dependence of the ignition delay time on the uncertain inputs. Results indicate that τign is mostly sensitive to variations in four dominant reaction classes, namely, H–atom abstraction from the fuel (reaction class 2), addition of O2 to the fuel radicals (reaction class 11), fuel radical isomerization including Waddington type reactions (reaction class 15), and concerted elimination reactions (reaction class 16). We consequently focus our attention on these four reaction classes, and consider variations within corresponding subrules. We explore two approaches to define the subrules of reaction class 2, one based on the radical abstracting from the fuel resulting in eleven subrules and another based on the abstraction site resulting in five subrules. Hence, we investigate the sensitivity of τign due to variability in the rate parameters of 26 and 20 subrules of the resulting models. In particular, the simulations indicate that in reaction class 2 H–atom abstraction by HO2 dominates the variability in τign at all initial conditions considered. Analysis of this finding reveals that correlations inherent in the rate rule construction plays an important role in the resulting sensitivity predictions, and suggests a hierarchical approach to the calibration of elementary reaction rates.},

At low temperatures, and for aromatic fuels, the reactions that dominate and control the reaction kinetics are those associated with the parent fuel and its daughter radicals. Strategies used to develop and optimize chemical kinetic mechanisms are discussed and some reference is made to lumped and reduced mechanisms.

In order to better understand gasoline combustion, this study investigated the ignition propensity of two alkane-rich FACE (Fuels for Advanced Combustion Engines) gasoline test fuels and their corresponding PRF (primary reference fuel) blend in fundamental combustion experiments. Shock tube ignition delay times were measured in two separate facilities at pressures of 10, 20, and 40bar, temperatures from 715 to 1500K, and two equivalence ratios. Rapid compression machine ignition delay times were measured for fuel/air mixtures at pressures of 20 and 40bar, temperatures from 632 to 745K, and two equivalence ratios. Detailed hydrocarbon analysis was also performed on the FACE gasoline fuels, and the results were used to formulate multi-component gasoline surrogate mixtures. Detailed chemical kinetic modeling results are presented herein to provide insights into the relevance of utilizing PRF and multi-component surrogate mixtures to reproduce the ignition behavior of the alkane-rich FACE gasoline fuels. The two FACE gasoline fuels and their corresponding PRF mixture displayed similar ignition behavior at intermediate and high temperatures, but differences were observed at low temperatures. These trends were mimicked by corresponding surrogate mixture models, except for the amount of heat release in the first stage of a two-stage ignition events, when observed.},

  abstract = {Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) constructs kinetic models composed of elementary chemical reaction steps using a general understanding of how molecules react. Species thermochemistry is estimated through Benson group additivity and reaction rate coefficients are estimated using a database of known rate rules and reaction templates. At its core, RMG relies on two fundamental data structures: graphs and trees. Graphs are used to represent chemical structures, and trees are used to represent thermodynamic and kinetic data. Models are generated using a rate-based algorithm which excludes species from the model based on reaction fluxes. RMG can generate reaction mechanisms for species involving carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulfur, and nitrogen. It also has capabilities for estimating transport and solvation properties, and it automatically computes pressure-dependent rate coefficients and identifies chemically-activated reaction paths. RMG is an object-oriented program written in Python, which provides a stable, robust programming architecture for developing an extensible and modular code base with a large suite of unit tests. Computationally intensive functions are cythonized for speed improvements.

  abstract = {Diethyl ether (DEE) has been recently suggested as a potential biofuel for compression-ignition engines that are known to be significantly controlled by low-temperature (LT) chemistry. However, the LT oxidation of DEE has not fully been understood in term of the formation of LT fuel-specific products. We have thus studied the oxidation of DEE by examining detailed profiles of its oxidation products under LT conditions (400–1100 K). To this end, we have used a dedicated experimental setup including a nearly-atmospheric jet-stirred reactor (JSR) coupled to online gas chromatography (GC). The experiments were complemented by measurements made with a JSR coupled to tunable synchrotron vacuum ultraviolet (SVUV) photoionization (PI) molecular-beam mass spectrometry (MBMS) for a cross-validation of the identification of important LT species. Experimental results indicate that DEE is very reactive; it starts to react around 425 K. DEE exhibits an unusual oxidation behavior with two negative temperature coefficient (NTC) zones in the JSR study. Because of this two-NTC observation, additional experiments were performed with a plug flow reactor (PFR) combined with electron ionization (EI)-MBMS, confirming this behavior in the two types of reactor. Moreover, about 20 oxidation species in C1C4 range were detected with several intermediates containing 2-3 O-atoms. Acetic acid is found to peak at 525 K with a very large amount, suggesting that it is a key species in the early stage of DEE's LT oxidation. Possible DEE-consumption paths leading to acetic acid formation could play an important role in the oxidation mechanism of DEE. A new model is proposed based on the present experimental observations to include new primary LT reaction paths. The model reproduces the experimental phenomena quite well and enhances the understanding of the two-NTC-zone occurrence and of intermediates containing 2-3 O-atoms during the LT oxidation of DEE.},

  abstract = {In view of the critical role of the underlying uncertainties of the reaction model in future progress of combustion chemistry modeling, Foundational Fuel Chemistry Model 1.0 (FFCM-1) was developed with uncertainty minimization against available fundamental combustion data of H2, H2/CO, CH4, CH2O, and C2H6. As a critical feature, FFCM-1 not only reconciles a large body of fundamental combustion data, it also has rigorously evaluated uncertainties for the rate coefficients, the combustion experimental targets used for model optimization and uncertainty minimization, and most importantly, an optimized reaction model with quantified uncertainties. In the present work, the remaining kinetic uncertainties of FFCM-1 are examined using a perfectly stirred reactor (PSR) as the relevant model platform for which reliable experiments under the conditions tested are unavailable. The key questions to address include the level of improvement from model optimization in the prediction uncertainties of PSR residence times at extinction and ignition and the rate coefficients of reactions that must be improved in order to reduce the prediction uncertainties. Computational tests are made for H2/CO, CH2O, CH4, CH3OH and C2H4–air mixtures over the pressure range of 10–100 atm and PSR inlet temperatures that would yield residence times comparable to the time scales typical of fuel combustion in practical combustors. The results show that although model optimization reduces the prediction uncertainties of residence time at extinction and ignition, the remaining uncertainties remain rather large. Key reactions for which reduced rate uncertainties would greatly improve the reaction model quality and accuracy have been identified and discussed in detail.},

A comparison was made between some of the calculated rate constants and literature data. A detailed kinetic mechanism for DEE ignition contains 341 species and 1867 reactions was developed mainly based on the theoretical calculation and literature data and it was then further compared with the literature measurements along with three other existing DEE models, the Yasunaga model, the Sakai model and the Tran model. Compared with the other three models, the current model can give reasonable predictions on the validated ignition data over a wider temperature range. Based on the current model, a skeletal mechanism which contains 49 species and 192 reactions was developed by using a Jacobian-aided DRGEP approach, followed with a TSA method. The skeletal mechanism can precisely represent the detailed mechanism under a wide range of compression engine related conditions for DEE ignition. Finally, reaction pathway analysis and sensitivity analysis was conducted using the current model to gain an in-depth comprehension on DEE ignition at different temperatures.},

This work was performed using a jet-stirred reactor at pressures from 26.7kPa (200Torr) to 107.7kPa (800Torr) with dilution in helium, for residence time from 1 to 10s and an inlet fuel concentration from 1 to 5%. Temperature was the parameter with the largest influence on reactivity. The complete destruction of diethyl ether was observed from 1080K. A decrease of residence time and pressure also slightly decreased reactivity, but the effect of pressure remained very limited. Major products were carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene and acetaldehyde. Minor products were ethane, acetylene, propane, propene, ethanol, 1,3-butadiene, and benzene. Two literature models including diethyl ether reactions have been used to simulate these results, with in both cases a satisfactory agreement between experiments and simulations for fuel conversion and the formation of most of the products. Simulations using a literature model for the thermal decomposition of diethyl sulfide indicated that in the studied conditions, the sulfur compound would be completely decomposed at a temperature about 100K lower than the oxygenated reactant.},

Along with C1-2 hydrocarbon data reported in a recent study, the entire dataset was used to demonstrate how laminar flame speed data can be utilized to explore and minimize the uncertainties in a reaction model for foundation fuels. The USC Mech II kinetic model was chosen as a case study. The method of uncertainty minimization using polynomial chaos expansions (MUM-PCE) (Sheen and Wang, 2011) was employed to constrain the model uncertainty for laminar flame speed predictions. Results demonstrate that a reaction model constrained only by the laminar flame speed values of methane/air flames notably reduces the uncertainty in the predictions of the laminar flame speeds of C3 and C4 alkanes, because the key chemical pathways of all of these flames are similar to each other. The uncertainty in model predictions for flames of unsaturated C3–4 hydrocarbons remain significant without considering fuel specific laminar flames speeds in the constraining target data set, because the secondary rate controlling reaction steps are different from those in the saturated alkanes. It is shown that the constraints provided by the laminar flame speeds of the foundation fuels could reduce notably the uncertainties in the predictions of laminar flame speeds of C4 alcohol/air mixtures. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that an accurate prediction of the laminar flame speed of a particular C4 alcohol/air mixture is better achieved through measurements for key molecular intermediates formed during the pyrolysis and oxidation of the parent fuel.},

  abstract = { Increasing carbon dioxide accumulation in earth’s atmosphere and the depletion of fossil resources pose huge challenges for our society and, in particular, for all stakeholders in the transportation sector. The Cluster of Excellence ‘Tailor-Made Fuels from Biomass’ at RWTH Aachen University establishes innovative and sustainable processes for the conversion of whole plants into molecularly well-defined fuels exhibiting tailored properties for low-temperature combustion engine processes, enabling high efficiency and low pollutant emissions. The concept of fuel design, that is, considering fuel’s molecular structure to be a design degree of freedom, aims for the simultaneous optimisation of fuel production and combustion systems. In the present contribution, three examples of tailor-made biofuels are presented. For spark ignition engines, both 2-methylfuran and 2-butanone show increased knock resistance compared to RON95 gasoline, thus enabling a higher compression ratio and an efficiency gain of up to 20\% at full-load operation. Moreover, both fuels comprise a good mixture formation superior to the one of ethanol, especially under difficult boundary conditions. For compression ignition engines, 1-octanol enables a remarkable reduction in engine-out soot emissions compared to standard diesel fuel due to the high oxygen content and lower reactivity. This advantage is achieved without sacrificing the high indicated efficiency and low NOX emissions. },

  abstract = {Re-evaluation of the temperature-dependent uncertainty parameter f(T) of elementary reactions is proposed by considering all available direct measurements and theoretical calculations. A procedure is presented for making f(T) consistent with the form of the recommended Arrhenius expression. The corresponding uncertainty domain of the transformed Arrhenius parameters (ln A, n, E/R) is convex and centrally symmetric around the mean parameter set. The f(T) function can be stored efficiently using the covariance matrix of the transformed Arrhenius parameters. The calculation of the uncertainty of a backward rate coefficient from the uncertainty of the forward rate coefficient and thermodynamic data is discussed. For many rate coefficients, a large number of experimental and theoretical determinations are available, and a normal distribution can be assumed for the uncertainty of ln k. If little information is available for the rate coefficient, equal probability of the transformed Arrhenius parameters within their domain of uncertainty (i.e. uniform distribution) can be assumed. Algorithms are provided for sampling the transformed Arrhenius parameters with either normal or uniform distributions. A suite of computer codes is presented that allows the straightforward application of these methods. For 22 important elementary reactions of the H2 and syngas (wet CO) combustion systems, the Arrhenius parameters and 3rd body collision efficiencies were collected from experimental, theoretical and review publications. For each elementary reaction, kmin and kmax limits were determined at several temperatures within a defined range of temperature. These rate coefficient limits were used to obtain a consistent uncertainty function f(T) and to calculate the covariance matrix of the transformed Arrhenius parameters.},

  abstract = {The development of accurate chemical kinetic models capable of predicting the combustion of methane and dimethyl ether in common combustion environments such as compression ignition engines and gas turbines is important as it provides valuable data and understanding of these fuels under conditions that are difficult and expensive to study in the real combustors. In this work, both experimental and chemical kinetic model-predicted ignition delay time data are provided covering a range of conditions relevant to gas turbine environments (T=600–1600K, p=7–41atm, ϕ=0.3, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 in ‘air’ mixtures). The detailed chemical kinetic model (Mech_56.54) is capable of accurately predicting this wide range of data, and it is the first mechanism to incorporate high-level rate constant measurements and calculations where available for the reactions of DME. This mechanism is also the first to apply a pressure-dependent treatment to the low-temperature reactions of DME. It has been validated using available literature data including flow reactor, jet-stirred reactor, shock-tube ignition delay times, shock-tube speciation, flame speed, and flame speciation data. New ignition delay time measurements are presented for methane, dimethyl ether, and their mixtures; these data were obtained using three different shock tubes and a rapid compression machine. In addition to the DME/CH4 blends, high-pressure data for pure DME and pure methane were also obtained. Where possible, the new data were compared with existing data from the literature, with good agreement.},

  abstract = {Due to the rapid advance in analytical methods, a large detail of intermediate products from the low temperature oxidation of hydrocarbon fuels in jet stirred reactors became recently available in the literature. This new comprehensive information allowed to highlight systematic deviations between model predictions and experimental measurements, both in some oxygenated species and in fuel conversion at very low temperatures (550–650K). These discrepancies are largely reduced by including new reaction classes in the oxidation mechanism. Successive H-abstraction and molecular reactions of hydroperoxide species are proved to play a relevant role at very low temperatures, in competition with the chain branching decomposition reactions. Several recombination and disproportionation reactions of peroxy radicals are also of interest in explaining some intermediate oxygenated components. The aim of this paper is to discuss and analyze the ability of these new reaction classes to explain the formation of oxygenated species, such as organic acids and dicarbonyl species. Rate constants were determined using similarity and analogy rules for consolidated reactions, while theoretical calculations were performed to determine preliminary estimates for reaction channels lacking a reference reaction. Detailed comparisons with several experimental data of propane and n-butane oxidation at low temperatures support these assumptions. This kinetic study points out the need of further research activities in the investigation of successive reactions of hydroperoxide species.},

  abstract = {Unsaturated hydrocarbons are an important component of hydrocarbon fuels and intermediates in their oxidation. Under rich conditions, H atom attack is one of the principal pathways of the decomposition of these unsaturated compounds. Consequently, it is critical to understand the H atom attack mechanisms as part of chemical model development. Previous studies have examined the kinetics of H atom attack on various unsaturated hydrocarbons in single pulse shock-tubes. These studies have noted that there are multiple pathways by which H atom attack can proceed, so it is straightforward to measure relative rates but absolute rates are more difficult to estimate. In addition, there is a confounding influence from secondary chemistry. A multiparameter optimization and uncertainty minimization technique is used to constrain a chemical model for the oxidation of H2/CO/C1–C4 hydrocarbons against a range of measurements of the H atom attack process on toluene, trimethylbenzene (TMB), propyne, and propene. The recommended rate constant expressions, with 2σ uncertainties, are as follows:k(CH4+H↔CH3+H2)=108.81±0.21s-1cm3mol-1K1.6T1.6exp(-5400±500K/T)k(C2H2+CH3↔p-C3H4+H)=1011.17±0.18s-1cm3mol-1K0.6T0.6exp(-7200±400K/T)k(p-C3H4+H↔a-C3H4+H)=1018.20±0.21s-1cm3mol-1KT-1exp(-6100±500K/T)k(C3H6+H↔C2H4+CH3)=1024.80±0.20s-1cm3mol-1K3T-3exp(-7400±700K/T)k(C3H6+H↔a-C3H5+H2)=105.14±0.19s-1cm3mol-1K-2.5T2.5exp(-1300±200K/T)k(C6H5CH3+H↔C6H6+CH3)=106.23±0.19s-1cm3mol-1K-2.2T2.2exp(-2000±400K/T)k(C6H5CH3+H↔C6H5CH2+H2)=1014.17±0.25s-1cm3mol-1exp(-4500±500K/T)k(TMB+H↔m-xylene+CH3)=1014.07±0.18s-1cm3mol-1exp(-3900±400K/T)k(TMB+H↔(CH3)2)=1014.52±0.25s-1cm3mol-1exp(-4300±600K/T) In addition, we quantify the effect of secondary chemistry on these rate estimates and the contribution to their uncertainty. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the detailed measurements constrain the model’s predictions of global properties such as ignition delay time in propene oxidation.},

Predictions are obtained from ab initio transition state theory based master equation calculations. The fundamental parameters for these rate predictions include barrier heights, well depths, vibrational frequencies, collision frequency, and energy transfer parameters. A random sampling high-dimensional model representation (HDMR) approach is used to perform the global sensitivity analysis. This approach determines the predicted distributions of the phenomenological rate coefficients based on a quasi-random sample of the fundamental parameters within their uncertainty range. Sensitivity analysis then identifies the main parameters which contribute to variance in the predicted distributions. Here the approach is applied to a study of the oxidation of the propyl radical, employing the parameters derived in our recent theoretical study. We find rates at 3σ variances that typically differ from the most frequent values by factors of 4–6, with the uncertainties decreasing with increasing temperature. For the well skipping reactions there are more parameters that contribute significantly to the variance, the second-order sensitivities are greater, and the uncertainties increased with increasing pressure. For the other reactions, the uncertainties tend to decrease with increasing pressure.},

The tests are conducted using each of the fuel blends or neat diesel fuel, with the engine working at three different loads. Fuel consumption, exhaust smoke, and regulated gas emissions such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons are measured. The differences in the performance and exhaust emission parameters of the three DEE/diesel fuel blends from the baseline operation of the diesel engine, i.e., when working with neat diesel fuel, are compared. Combustion chamber and fuel injection pressure diagrams are obtained, and heat release rate analysis of the experimentally obtained cylinder pressure diagrams is performed, revealing some interesting features of the combustion mechanisms. These results and the widely differing physical and chemical properties of DEE against those for diesel fuel are used to aid the interpretation of the observed engine behavior.

The results obtained in this study are also compared with those of the available biogas-diesel dual-fuel and biogas spark ignition (SI) modes. From the results, it is found that biogas-DEE HCCI mode shows wider operating load range and higher brake thermal efficiency (BTE) at all loads as compared to those of biogas-diesel dual-fuel and biogas SI modes. In HCCI mode, at 4.52bar BMEP, as compared to dual-fuel and SI modes, BTE shows an improvement of about 3.48 and 9.21% respectively. Also, nitric oxide (NO) and smoke emissions are extremely low, and carbon monoxide (CO) emission is below 0.4% by volume at best brake thermal efficiency points. Also, in general, in HCCI mode, hydrocarbon (HC) emissions are lower than that of biogas SI mode. Therefore, it is beneficial to use biogas-DEE HCCI mode while using biogas in internal combustion engines.},

Compared to some of the other leading alternative fuel candidates (i.e., methane, methanol, ethanol, and Fischer–Tropsch fuels), dimethyl ether appears to have the largest potential impact on society, and should be considered as the fuel of choice for eliminating the dependency on petroleum. DME can be used as a clean high-efficiency compression ignition fuel with reduced NOx, SOx, and particulate matter, it can be efficiently reformed to hydrogen at low temperatures, and does not have large issues with toxicity, production, infrastructure, and transportation as do various other fuels. The literature relevant to DME use is reviewed and summarized to demonstrate the viability of DME as an alternative fuel.},

  abstract = {Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) are a good example of a significant breakthrough in chemical science that is directly enabled by the US DOE SciDAC initiative. ATcT is a new paradigm of how to obtain accurate, reliable, and internally consistent thermochemistry and overcome the limitations that are intrinsic to the traditional sequential approach to thermochemistry. The availability of high-quality consistent thermochemical values is critical in many areas of chemistry, including the development of realistic predictive models of complex chemical environments such as combustion or the atmosphere, or development and improvement of sophisticated high-fidelity electronic structure computational treatments. As opposed to the traditional sequential evolution of thermochemical values for the chemical species of interest, ATcT utilizes the Thermochemical Network (TN) approach. This approach explicitly exposes the maze of inherent interdependencies normally ignored by the conventional treatment, and allows, inter alia , a statistical analysis of the individual measurements that define the TN. The end result is the extraction of the best possible thermochemistry, based on optimal use of all the currently available knowledge, hence making conventional tabulations of thermochemical values obsolete. Moreover, ATcT offer a number of additional features that are neither present nor possible in the traditional approach. With ATcT, new knowledge can be painlessly propagated through all affected thermochemical values. ATcT also allows hypothesis testing and evaluation, as well as discovery of weak links in the TN. The latter provides pointers to new experimental or theoretical determinations that can most efficiently improve the underlying thermochemical body of knowledge.},

  abstract = {A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism has been developed and used to study the oxidation of iso-octane in a jet-stirred reactor, flow reactors, shock tubes and in a motored engine. Over the series of experiments investigated, the initial pressure ranged from 1 to 45 atm, the temperature from 550 K to 1700 K, the equivalence ratio from 0.3 to 1.5, with nitrogen-argon dilution from 70% to 99%. This range of physical conditions, together with the measurements of ignition delay time and concentrations, provide a broad-ranging test of the chemical kinetic mechanism. This mechanism was based on our previous modeling of alkane combustion and, in particular, on our study of the oxidation of n-heptane. Experimental results of ignition behind reflected shock waves were used to develop and validate the predictive capability of the reaction mechanism at both low and high temperatures. Moreover, species’ concentrations from flow reactors and a jet-stirred reactor were used to help complement and refine the low and intermediate temperature portions of the reaction mechanism, leading to good predictions of intermediate products in most cases. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed for each of the combustion environments in an attempt to identify the most important reactions under the relevant conditions of study.},

A brief review of the mathematical background of the technique is given. The concept of active parameters is discussed. The technique is applied to determine an optimum set of parameters for a methane combustion mechanism. Five independent responses—comprising ignition delay times, pre-ignition methyl radical concentration profiles, and laminar premixed flame velocities— were optimized with respect to thirteen reaction rate parameters. The numerical predictions of the optimized model are compared to those computed with several recent literature mechanisms.

The concept of a comprehensive mechanism is developed, requiring model validation by comparison with data from a wide range of experimental regimes. Fuels of increasing complexity from hydrogen to n-butane are described in detail, and further extensions of the general approach to other fuels are discussed. Kinetic modification to fuel oxidation kinetics is considered, including both inhibition and promotion of combustion. Simplified kinetic models are then described by comparing their features with those of detailed kinetic models. Finally, application of kinetic models to study real combustions systems are presented, beginning with purely kinetic-thermodynamic applications, in which transport effects such as diffusion of heat and mass can be neglected, such as shock tubes, detonations, plug flow reactors, and stirred reactors. Laminar flames and the coupling between diffusive transport and chemical kinetics are then described, together with applications of laminar flame models to practical combustion problems.},

  abstract = {Alcohols, such as butanol, are a class of molecules that have been proposed as a bio-derived alternative or blending agent for conventional petroleum derived fuels. The structural isomer in traditional “bio-butanol” fuel is 1-butanol, but newer conversion technologies produce iso-butanol and 2-butanol as fuels. Biological pathways to higher molecular weight alcohols have also been identified. In order to better understand the combustion chemistry of linear and branched alcohols, this study presents a comprehensive chemical kinetic model for all the four isomers of butanol (e.g., 1-, 2-, iso- and tert-butanol). The proposed model includes detailed high-temperature and low-temperature reaction pathways with reaction rates assigned to describe the unique oxidation features of linear and branched alcohols. Experimental validation targets for the model include low pressure premixed flat flame species profiles obtained using molecular beam mass spectrometry (MBMS), premixed laminar flame velocity, rapid compression machine and shock tube ignition delay, and jet-stirred reactor species profiles. The agreement with these various data sets spanning a wide range of temperatures and pressures is reasonably good. The validated chemical kinetic model is used to elucidate the dominant reaction pathways at the various pressures and temperatures studied. At low-temperature conditions, the reaction of 1-hydroxybutyl with O2 was important in controlling the reactivity of the system, and for correctly predicting C4 aldehyde profiles in low pressure premixed flames and jet-stirred reactors. Enol–keto isomerization reactions assisted by radicals and formic acid were also found to be important in converting enols to aldehydes and ketones under certain conditions. Structural features of the four different butanol isomers leading to differences in the combustion properties of each isomer are thoroughly discussed.},

  abstract = {Iso-Octane (2,2,4-trimethylpentane) is a primary reference fuel and an important component of gasoline fuels. Moreover, it is a key component used in surrogates to study the ignition and burning characteristics of gasoline fuels. This paper presents an updated chemical kinetic model for iso-octane combustion. Specifically, the thermodynamic data and reaction kinetics of iso-octane have been re-assessed based on new thermodynamic group values and recently evaluated rate coefficients from the literature. The adopted rate coefficients were either experimentally measured or determined by analogy to theoretically calculated values. Furthermore, new alternative isomerization pathways for peroxy-alkyl hydroperoxide (ȮOQOOH) radicals were added to the reaction mechanism. The updated kinetic model was compared against new ignition delay data measured in rapid compression machines (RCM) and a high-pressure shock tube. These experiments were conducted at pressures of 20 and 40 atm, at equivalence ratios of 0.4 and 1.0, and at temperatures in the range of 632–1060K. The updated model was further compared against shock tube ignition delay times, jet-stirred reactor oxidation speciation data, premixed laminar flame speeds, counterflow diffusion flame ignition, and shock tube pyrolysis speciation data available in the literature. Finally, the updated model was used to investigate the importance of alternative isomerization pathways in the low temperature oxidation of highly branched alkanes. When compared to available models in the literature, the present model represents the current state-of-the-art in fundamental thermochemistry and reaction kinetics of iso-octane; and thus provides the best prediction of wide ranging experimental data and fundamental insights into iso-octane combustion chemistry.},

  abstract = {This work presents an updated experimental and kinetic modeling study of n-heptane oxidation. In the experiments, ignition delay times of stoichiometric n-heptane/air mixtures have been measured in two different high-pressure shock tubes in the temperature range of 726–1412K and at elevated pressures (15, 20 and 38bar). Meanwhile, concentration versus time profiles of species have been measured in a jet-stirred reactor at atmospheric pressure, in the temperature range of 500–1100K at φ=0.25, 2.0 and 4.0. These experimental results are consistent with those from the literature at similar conditions and extend the current data base describing n-heptane oxidation. Based on our experimental observations and previous modeling work, a detailed kinetic model has been developed to describe n-heptane oxidation. This kinetic model has adopted reaction rate rules consistent with those recently developed for the pentane isomers and for n-hexane. The model has been validated against data sets from both the current work and the literature using ignition delay times, speciation profiles measured in a jet-stirred reactor and laminar flame speeds over a wide range of conditions. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data. The model has also been compared with several recently published kinetic models of n-heptane and shows an overall better performance. This model may contribute to the development of kinetic mechanisms of other fuels, as n-heptane is a widely used primary reference fuel. Since the sub-mechanisms of n-pentane, n-hexane and n-heptane have adopted consistent reaction rate rules, the model is more likely to accurately simulate the oxidation of mixtures of these fuels. In addition, the successful implementation of these rate rules have indicated the possibility of their application for the development of mechanisms for larger hydrocarbon fuels, which are of great significance for practical combustion devices.},

The experimental data were used as validation targets for the model described in detail in an accompanying study [14]. The present study presents ignition delay time data for the pentane isomers at equivalence ratios of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 in ‘air’ (additionally, 0.3 in ‘air’ for n-, and iso-pentane) at pressures of 1, 10, and 20 atm in the shock tube, and 10 and 20 atm in the rapid compression machine, as well as data at an equivalence ratio of 1.0 in 99% argon, at pressures near 1 and 10 atm in a shock tube. An infrared laser absorption technique at 3.39 µm was used to verify the composition of the richest mixtures in the shock-tube tests by measuring directly the pentane isomer concentration in the driven section. By using shock tubes and a rapid compression machine, it was possible to investigate temperatures ranging from 643 to 1718 K. A detailed chemical kinetic model was used to simulate the experimental ignition delay times, and these are well-predicted for all of the isomers over all ranges of temperature, pressure, and mixture composition. In-depth analyses, including reaction path and sensitivity analyses, of the oxidation mechanisms of each of the isomers are presented. To the authors’ knowledge, this study covers conditions not yet presented in the literature and will, in conjunction with the aforementioned accompanying study, expand fundamental knowledge of the combustion kinetics of the pentane isomers and of alkanes in general.},

  abstract = {Ignition delay times for n-hexane oxidation have been measured in a rapid compression machine (RCM) at stoichiometric conditions and at 15 bar. Due to the high reactivity of n-hexane and non-ideal experimental effects associated with measuring short ignition delay times in the RCM (i.e. under 5 ms), further experiments were performed in a high-pressure shock tube for multiple fuel mixtures at equivalence ratios of φ = 1 and φ = 2 over the temperature range of 627–1365 K at pressures of 15 and 32 bar. To further study the concentration of intermediate species during the oxidation process, experiments have also been carried out in a jet-stirred reactor over a wide temperature range of 530–1160 K at 10 atm pressure and at equivalence ratios of φ = 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0. Species which include reactants, intermediates and products were identified and quantified as a function of temperature. These experimental results were used to aid the development and validation of a detailed kinetic model. The low-temperature chemistry of n-hexane has been refined by adopting alternative isomerization reactions for peroxyl alkylhydroperoxide (O˙2QOOH) radicals, leading to more detailed chemistry for this type of intermediate with multiple product channels. This mechanism has adopted a series of new reaction rates and rate rules mostly from recently reported high-level calculations. Slight modifications have been made to the suggested reaction rates and rate rules within their reported uncertainty ranges to achieve better agreement with the experimental results for both ignition delay times and speciation measurements. The new model has been validated against the experimental data presented here, with an overall good agreement compared to the experimental results. The molecular structure of n-hexane is more representative of normal alkanes that may be found in transportation relevant fuels (e.g. gasoline) compared to those with shorter carbon chains which is important in developing a robust sub-mechanism of base chemistry for larger, more practical fuels. Since the modified reaction rate rules presented in this work have shown to successfully predict the oxidation kinetics of n-hexane, these rate rules could be the basis for the development of mechanisms for even larger normal alkanes that are more representative of diesel and jet fuels. As a further demonstration of the utility of the rate rules they are shown to predict well ignition delay times and species concentrations measured at low temperature for n-heptane oxidation from previous studies.},

A consistent set of 12 Benson groups transferable among these six molecular families is derived from CBS-Q results via regression together with 20 hydrogen bond increment (HBI) group values for estimating the thermochemistry of oxymethyl (˙CH2OX){,} oxyethyl (CH3CH˙OX){,} oxyisopropyl ((CH3)2C˙OX) with varying substituent X (= H{,} CH3{,} C(O)H{,} C(O)CH3{,} OH{,} OCH3) and alkoxycarbonyl (ROC(O)˙) radicals. These new groups are useful in estimating the thermochemistry of large oxygenated molecules and radicals involved in complex chemical reaction mechanisms. The kinetics of nearly 50 elementary bimolecular hydrogen abstraction reactions belonging to eight different reaction families viz.{,} (i) CH3OX + H˙ → ˙CH2OX + H2{,} (ii) CH3OX + ˙CH3 → ˙CH2OX + CH4{,} (iii) CH3CH2OX + H˙ → CH3C˙HOX + H2{,} (iv) CH3CH2OX + ˙CH3 → CH3C˙HOX + CH4{,} (v) (CH3)2CHOX + H˙ → (CH3)2C˙OX + H2{,} (vi) HC(O)OR + H˙ → ˙C(O)OR + H2{,} (vii) HC(O)OR + ˙CH3 → ˙C(O)OR + CH4{,} (viii) ROOH + H˙ → ROO˙ + H2 are studied using transition state theory coupled with CBS-Q energetics. The calculated barrier height within a given reaction family varies with the nature of the β substituents. The reliability of the calculated variations in the barrier height with varying β substituents is determined through comparison of the calculated rate constants with the scarcely available experimental data. Thermodynamically consistent generic rate rules have been derived in terms of group additivity. New transferable supergroup values corresponding to the thermochemistry of the reactive moiety in transition structures are developed. The effect of non-next neighbor substituents on the enthalpy of the supergroup is quantified using Evans–Polanyi relations.},

Multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network (ANN) fitting were used to obtain the contributions from individual groups and group interactions for further predictions. Compared with the conventional group additivity (GA) method{,} the DBGC method predicts Hf{,}298K for alkanes more accurately using the same training sets. Particularly for some highly branched large hydrocarbons{,} the discrepancy with the literature data is smaller for the DBGC method than the conventional GA method. When extended to other molecular classes{,} including alkenes and radicals{,} the overall accuracy level of this new method is still satisfactory.},

We examine three variants of the linearization method, the likelihood method, and the lack-of-fit method. The linearization method is computationally inexpensive, produces easily understandable results, and is widely used in practice. The likelihood and lack-of-fit methods are much more expensive and more difficult to report. In our tests, both the likelihood and lack-of-fit methods perform very reliably. All three variants of the linearization method, however, often grossly underestimate confidence regions and sometimes significantly underestimate confidence intervals. The linearization method variant based solely on the Jacobian matrix appears preferable to the two variants that use the full Hessian matrix because it is less expensive, more numerically stable, and at least as accurate. The Bates and Watts curvature measures are consistent with our results.},

This research project presents a detailed and reduced chemical kinetic mechanism for singly methylated iso-alkanes (i.e., 2-methylalkanes) ranging from C7 to C20. The mechanism also includes an updated version of our previously published C8–C16 n-alkanes model. The complete detailed mechanism contains approximately 7200 species 31400 reactions. The proposed model is validated against new experimental data from a variety of fundamental combustion devices including premixed and non-premixed flames, perfectly stirred reactors and shock tubes.

  abstract = {Large reaction mechanisms are often used to describe the combustion behavior of transportation-relevant fuels like gasoline, where these are typically represented by surrogate blends, e.g., n-heptane/iso-octane/toluene. We describe efforts to quantify the uncertainty in the predictions of such mechanisms at realistic engine conditions, seeking to better understand the robustness of the model as well as the important reaction pathways and their impacts on combustion behavior. In this work, we examine the importance of taking into account correlations among reactions that utilize the same rate rules and those with multiple product channels on forward propagation of uncertainty by Monte Carlo simulations. Automated means are developed to generate the uncertainty factor assignment for a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism, by first uniquely identifying each reacting species, then sorting each of the reactions based on the rate rule utilized. Simulation results reveal that in the low temperature combustion regime for iso-octane, the majority of the uncertainty in the model predictions can be attributed to low temperature reactions of the fuel sub-mechanism. The foundational, or small-molecule chemistry (C0C4) only contributes significantly to uncertainties in the predictions at the highest temperatures (Tc=900K). Accounting for correlations between important reactions is shown to produce non-negligible differences in the estimates of uncertainty. Including correlations among reactions that use the same rate rules increases uncertainty in the model predictions, while accounting for correlations among reactions with multiple branches decreases uncertainty in some cases. Significant non-linear response is observed in the model predictions depending on how the probability distributions of the uncertain rate constants are defined. It is concluded that care must be exercised in defining these probability distributions in order to reduce bias, and physically unrealistic estimates in the forward propagation of uncertainty for a range of UQ activities.},

The alkanes, n-hexane, 2-methyl-pentane, 3-methyl-pentane, 2,2-dimethyl-butane, 2,3-dimethyl-butane, 2-methyl-heptane, and 4-methyl-heptane, were selected to investigate the rates of site-specific H-abstraction by OH at secondary and tertiary carbons. Hydroxyl radicals were monitored using narrow-line-width ring-dye laser absorption of the R1(5) transition of the OH spectrum near 306.7nm. The high sensitivity of the diagnostic enabled the use of low reactant concentrations and pseudo-first-order kinetics. Rate constants were measured at temperatures ranging from 880K to 1440K and pressures near 1.5atm. High-temperature measurements of the rate constants for OH+n-hexane and OH+2,2-dimethyl-butane are in agreement with earlier studies, and the rate constants of the five other alkanes with OH, we believe, are the first direct measurements at combustion temperatures. Using these measurements and the site-specific H-abstraction measurements of Sivaramakrishnan and Michael (2009) [1,2], general expressions for three secondary and two tertiary abstraction rates were determined as follows (the subscripts indicate the number of carbon atoms bonded to the next-nearest-neighbor carbon): S20=1.58×10-11exp(-1550K/T)cm3molecule-1s-1(887–1327K)S30=2.37×10-11exp(-1850K/T)cm3molecule-1s-1(887–1327K)S21=4.5×10-12exp(-793.7K/T)cm3molecule-1s-1(833–1440K)T100=2.85×10-11exp(-1138.3K/T)cm3molecule-1s-1(878–1375K)T101=7.16×10-12exp(-993K/T)cm3molecule-1s-1(883–1362K)},

Starting from a modified version of the methanol combustion mechanism of Li et al. (2007) and adopting the H2/CO base chemistry from the joint optimized hydrogen and syngas combustion mechanism of Varga et al. (2016), an optimization of 57 Arrhenius parameters of 17 important elementary reactions was performed, using several thousand indirect measurement data points, as well as direct and theoretical determinations of reaction rate coefficients as optimization targets. The final optimized mechanism was compared to 18 reaction mechanisms published in recent years, with respect to their accuracy in reproducing the available indirect experimental data for methanol and formaldehyde combustion. The utilized indirect measurement data, in total 24,900 data points in 265 datasets, include measurements of ignition delay times, laminar burning velocities and species profiles captured using a variety of experimental techniques. In addition to new best fit values for all rate parameters, the covariance matrix of the optimized parameters, which provides a quantitative description of the temperature-dependent ranges of uncertainty for the optimized rate coefficients, was calculated. These posterior uncertainty limits are much narrower than the prior limits in the temperature range for which experimental data are available. The uncertainty of the self-reaction of HȮ2 radicals and important H-atom abstraction reactions from the methanol molecule are discussed in detail.},

  abstract = {Kinetic models for complex chemical mechanisms are comprised of tens to thousands of reactions with rate constants informed by data from a wide variety of sources – rate constant measurements, global combustion experiments, and theoretical kinetics calculations. In order to integrate information from distinct data types in a self-consistent manner, a framework for combustion model development is presented that encapsulates behavior across a wide range of chemically relevant scales from fundamental molecular interactions to global combustion phenomena. The resulting kinetic model consists of a set of theoretical kinetics parameters (with constrained uncertainties), which are related through kinetics calculations to temperature/pressure/bath-gas-dependent rate constants (with propagated uncertainties), which in turn are related through physical models to combustion behavior (with propagated uncertainties). Direct incorporation of theory in combustion model development is expected to yield more reliable extrapolation of limited data to conditions outside the validation set, which is particularly useful for extrapolating to engine-relevant conditions where relatively limited data are available. Several key features of the approach are demonstrated for the H2O2 decomposition mechanism, where a number of its constituent reactions continue to have large uncertainties in their temperature and pressure dependence despite their relevance to high-pressure, low-temperature combustion of a variety of fuels. Here, we use the approach to provide a quantitative explanation for the apparent anomalous temperature dependence of OH+HO2=H2O+O2 – in a manner consistent with experimental data from the entire temperature range and ab initio transition-state theory within their associated uncertainties. Interestingly, we do find a rate minimum near 1200K, although the temperature dependence is substantially less pronounced than previously suggested.},

  abstract = {Side-by-side comparison of detailed kinetic models using a new tool to aid recognition of species structures reveals significant discrepancies in the published rates of many reactions and thermochemistry of many species. We present a first automated assessment of the impact of these varying parameters on observable quantities of interest—in this case, autoignition delay—using literature experimental data. A recent kinetic model for the isomers of butanol was imported into a common database. Individual reaction rate and thermodynamic parameters of species were varied using values encountered in combustion models from recent literature. The effects of over 1600 alternative parameters were considered. Separately, experimental data were collected from recent publications and converted into the standard YAML-based ChemKED format. The Cantera-based model validation tool, PyTeCK, was used to automatically simulate autoignition using the generated models and experimental data, to judge the performance of the models. Taken individually, most of the parameter substitutions have little effect on the overall model performance, although a handful have quite large effects, and are investigated more thoroughly. Additionally, models varying multiple parameters simultaneously were evolved using a genetic algorithm to give fastest and slowest autoignition delay times, showing that changes exceeding a factor of 10 in ignition delay time are possible by cherry-picking from only accepted, published parameters. All data and software used in this study are available openly.},

  abstract = {We report a cascaded group-additivity (CGA) ONIOM method for high-level energy calculations of large aliphatic hydrocarbon molecules by combining the group additivity and two-layer ONIOM methods. This hybrid method is implemented by partitioning the target molecule into individual groups, which are cascaded via the overlapping between them. The energy of the entire molecule is first calculated at a low level of theory such as M06-2x/cc-pVTZ. Then all the groups and their overlappings are treated at the levels of CCSD(T)/CBS and M06-2x/cc-pVTZ to obtain their energy difference to be used as the energy correction. We selected small-to-middle size aliphatic hydrocarbons including 79 C4C8 molecules as the validation set to demonstrate the feasibility of the CGA-ONIOM method, followed by the calculations of 12 representative C10, C12 and C16 aliphatic hydrocarbons (including normal-, branched-, cyclo- and unsaturated categories). Our calculations agree well with the reference values available in the literature with the modest deviation around 1.0 kcal mol−1. Compared with the conventional CCSD(T)/CBS calculation of the whole molecule, the computational cost can be dramatically reduced by a factor of ∼102 for molecules with 10 carbons and ∼104 for molecules with 16 carbons. Considering its outstanding computational efficiency and accuracy, our proposed CGA-ONIOM method is promising for combustion chemistry studies of large fuel molecules at a high level of theory.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Automatic kinetic mechanism generation, virtual high-throughput screening, and automatic transition state search are currently trending applications requiring exploration of a large molecule space. Large-scale search requires fast and accurate estimation of molecules' properties of interest, such as thermochemistry. Existing approaches are not satisfactory for large polycyclic molecules: considering the number of molecules being screened, quantum chemistry (even cheap density functional theory methods) can be computationally expensive, and group additivity, though fast, is not sufficiently accurate. This paper provides a fast and moderately accurate alternative by proposing a polycyclic thermochemistry estimation method that extends the group additivity method with two additional algorithms: similarity match and bicyclic decomposition. It significantly reduces Hf(298 K) estimation error from over 60 kcal/mol (group additivity method) to around 5 kcal/mol, Cp(298 K) error from 9 to 1 cal/mol/K, and S(298 K) error from 70 to 7 cal/mol/K. This method also works well for heteroatomic polycyclics. A web application for estimating thermochemistry by this method is made available at http://rmg.mit.edu/molecule\_search.},
