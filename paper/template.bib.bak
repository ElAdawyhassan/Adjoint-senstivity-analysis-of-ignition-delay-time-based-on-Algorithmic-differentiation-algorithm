  abstract  = {The purpose of this paper is to show the application of global uncertainty analysis to comprehensive and reduced kinetic models as a tool to identify important thermochemical and reaction rate parameters as determinants of the conditions leading to autoignition. Propane oxidation is taken as the test case. The simulation of experimental investigations of the cool flames and two-stage ignitions{,} via the pressure-temperature ignition diagram{,} show that existing kinetic models for the low temperature combustion of propane at sub-atmospheric pressures reflect a greater reactivity than seems to be appropriate. That is{,} the models lead to a prediction of two-stage ignition at pressures somewhat lower and with ignition delays shorter than is found experimentally. The inconsistency between experiment and numerical simulation seems not to be an inherent problem of the qualitative structure of the models{,} but may derive from uncertainties in the parameters within the mechanism. By use of {"}brute force{"}{,} Morris-one-at-a-time and Monte-Carlo simulations{,} we show that uncertainties in only a small number of parameters{,} and falling well within the errors that may reasonably be assigned{,} can shift the response appropriately. Moreover{,} it appears that in the low temperature combustion regime{,} thermochemistry is at least as{,} if not more{,} important than the reaction rates{,} yet usually receives less attention within sensitivity studies. In the present case{,} the main factors controlling the temperature reached in the first stage of two-stage ignition and the time to ignition appear to be connected with the thermochemistry of three specific hydroperoxyalkyl radicals and their derivatives. Other factors{,} such as heat and mass transport are also addressed{,} and their effects are mitigated to some extent by evaluation of initial and revised models against experimental data for ignition delay obtained under microgravity. The results highlight more general issues that pertain to the numerical simulation of the combustion of higher hydrocarbons and contribute to the development of the protocol necessary for testing kinetic models before they are ready for use in a predictive capacity.},

  abstract = {Active Thermochemical Tables (ATcT) are a good example of a significant breakthrough in chemical science that is directly enabled by the US DOE SciDAC initiative. ATcT is a new paradigm of how to obtain accurate, reliable, and internally consistent thermochemistry and overcome the limitations that are intrinsic to the traditional sequential approach to thermochemistry. The availability of high-quality consistent thermochemical values is critical in many areas of chemistry, including the development of realistic predictive models of complex chemical environments such as combustion or the atmosphere, or development and improvement of sophisticated high-fidelity electronic structure computational treatments. As opposed to the traditional sequential evolution of thermochemical values for the chemical species of interest, ATcT utilizes the Thermochemical Network (TN) approach. This approach explicitly exposes the maze of inherent interdependencies normally ignored by the conventional treatment, and allows, inter alia , a statistical analysis of the individual measurements that define the TN. The end result is the extraction of the best possible thermochemistry, based on optimal use of all the currently available knowledge, hence making conventional tabulations of thermochemical values obsolete. Moreover, ATcT offer a number of additional features that are neither present nor possible in the traditional approach. With ATcT, new knowledge can be painlessly propagated through all affected thermochemical values. ATcT also allows hypothesis testing and evaluation, as well as discovery of weak links in the TN. The latter provides pointers to new experimental or theoretical determinations that can most efficiently improve the underlying thermochemical body of knowledge.},

  abstract  = {A method for assessing and comparing the impact of uncertainties in both kinetic and thermodynamic parameters on the predictions of combustion chemistry models has been developed. Kinetic{,} thermodynamic and overall uncertainty parameters are defined{,} which allow tracking the sources of uncertainties for a particular model result. The method was applied to premixed laminar methane-air flames using the Leeds Methane Oxidation Mechanism (K. J. Hughes et al.{,} Int. J. Chem. Kinet.{,} 2001{,} 33{,} 513). Heat of formation and rate coefficient data for species and elementary reactions{,} respectively{,} related to methane combustion were collected from several recent reviews and critically assessed error limits were assigned to them. Local rate coefficient sensitivities and heat of formation sensitivities were calculated for lean ([small phi] = 0.62){,} stoichiometric ([small phi] = 1.00) and rich ([small phi] = 1.20) laminar atmospheric premixed methane-air flames. Uncertainties of flame velocity{,} maximum flame temperature and also the value and location of maximum concentration of radicals H{,} O{,} OH{,} CH and CH2 were obtained from the sensitivities and the uncertainties of thermodynamic and chemical kinetic data. The uncertainty of the calculated flame velocity is typically 2-5 cm s-1. Maximum flame temperature and concentration of H{,} O{,} and OH can be calculated accurately{,} while there is high uncertainty in the calculated maximum concentration of CH and CH2. The calculations have revealed that the uncertainty of the calculated flame velocity is caused mainly by errors of the input rate coefficients. This is the case also for the calculated concentration of CH and CH2. The uncertainty of the location of concentration maxima is also of kinetics origin and it is caused by the very same rate coefficients that affect flame velocity. Uncertainty of maximum adiabatic flame temperature and maximum concentration of H{,} O and OH originates mainly from errors of the input heat of formation data. In order to obtain good simulation results for methane flames{,} accurate heats of formation are required in particular for radicals OH{,} CH2(S){,} CH2{,} CH2OH{,} HCCO and CH2HCO. Simulation results could be improved by better knowledge of the reaction rate parameters for the reactions O2 + H = OH + O{,} O2 + H + M = HO2 + M{,} CO + OH = CO2 + H{,} H + CH3(+M) = CH4(+M){,} CH3 + OH = CH2(S) + H2O{,} C2H2 + OH = C2H + H2O and C2H2 + CH = C2H + CH2. This conclusion is somewhat surprising since at least the first three reactions are among the most frequently studied ones in chemical kinetics. The calculations demonstrate that all simulation results of chemical kinetic modelling studies should be accompanied by uncertainty information (e.g. standard deviation) for the model outputs to indicate which results are well supported by the model and which ones are merely nominal values that were obtained using the selected set of input parameters.},

  abstract = {Sensitivity analysis investigates the effect of parameter change on the solution of mathematical models. In chemical kinetics, models are usually based on differential equations and the results are concentration-time curves, reaction rates, and various kinetic features of the reaction. This review discusses in detail the concentration sensitivity, rate sensitivity, and feature sensitivity analysis of spatially homogeneous constant-parameter reaction systems. Sensitivity analyses of distributed parameter systems and of stochastic systems are also briefly described. Special attention is paid to the interpretation of sensitivity coefficients which can provide information about the importance and interconnection of parameters and variables. Applications of sensitivity analysis to uncertainty analysis, parameric scaling, parameter estimation, experimental design, stability analysis, repro-modeling, and investigation and reduction of complex reaction mechanisms are discussed profoundly.},
